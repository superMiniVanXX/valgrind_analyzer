# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides a Python script that analyzes Valgrind memory debugging logs and generates comprehensive Excel reports categorizing different types of memory issues. The tool will parse Valgrind output files, extract memory leak information, categorize issues by type, and present the findings in organized Excel worksheets for easy analysis and reporting.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze Valgrind log files automatically, so that I can quickly identify and categorize memory issues without manual parsing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Valgrind log file is provided THEN the system SHALL parse the file and extract all memory issue entries
2. WHEN parsing the log THEN the system SHALL identify different types of memory issues (definitely lost, possibly lost, still reachable, etc.)
3. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the problem
4. IF the log file is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and notify the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want memory issues categorized by type, so that I can prioritize fixes based on severity and impact.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing memory issues THEN the system SHALL categorize them into distinct types (definitely lost, possibly lost, still reachable, invalid reads/writes)
2. WHEN categorizing issues THEN the system SHALL extract relevant details including byte count, block count, and stack traces
3. WHEN multiple issues of the same type exist THEN the system SHALL aggregate statistics for each category
4. IF an unknown issue type is encountered THEN the system SHALL log it as "other" category

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed information about each memory issue, so that I can understand the root cause and location of problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extracting issue details THEN the system SHALL capture stack trace information with function names and line numbers
2. WHEN available THEN the system SHALL extract source file paths and line numbers
3. WHEN processing stack traces THEN the system SHALL identify the most relevant frames for debugging
4. IF debug symbols are missing THEN the system SHALL still capture available address information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want results exported to Excel format, so that I can share findings with team members and create reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating output THEN the system SHALL create an Excel file with multiple worksheets
2. WHEN creating worksheets THEN the system SHALL have separate sheets for summary, detailed issues, and statistics
3. WHEN populating data THEN the system SHALL include proper headers and formatting for readability
4. IF Excel creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback CSV export option

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a summary overview of all issues, so that I can quickly assess the overall memory health of my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating summary THEN the system SHALL provide total counts for each issue type
2. WHEN calculating statistics THEN the system SHALL show total bytes lost/leaked by category
3. WHEN creating overview THEN the system SHALL include percentage breakdown of issue types
4. WHEN displaying summary THEN the system SHALL highlight the most critical issues first
